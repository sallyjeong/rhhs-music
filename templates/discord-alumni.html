				<h2>Welcome back, alumni!</h2>
          <p>We're so happy to see you again!</p>
          <p>Since this website is fairly new, we don't quite have a way to verify if you're telling the truth or not, so here's how it's gonna work â€” join as a visitor for now, then once you're in, DM a staff member to prove you're really an alumni by telling them something that only a true RHHS Music alumni would know. If everything checks out, we'll be so glad to have you back!</p>
